{"id":"opencode-swarm-plugin-anlp2","title":"AI Agent Pattern Research: Plugin Improvement Analysis","description":"Research synthesis from PDF library (Patterns for Building AI Agents, Principles of Building AI Agents, Training Complex Cognitive Skills) applied to opencode-swarm-plugin improvements.\n\n## Key Patterns Identified\n\n### 1. Context Engineering (from Patterns for Building AI Agents)\n- **Current gap**: Our SUBTASK_PROMPT is verbose but lacks structured context sections\n- **Pattern**: \"Context engineering is both art and science\" - Karpathy\n- **Improvement**: Add explicit context sections: [IDENTITY] [TASK] [CONSTRAINTS] [TOOLS] [OUTPUT]\n\n### 2. Context Compression (p.37-39)\n- **Current gap**: No automatic context pruning between agent tasks\n- **Pattern**: \"Periodic context compression can prune irrelevant context\"\n- **Improvement**: Add `swarm_compress_context` tool that summarizes completed work\n\n### 3. Feed Errors Into Context (p.40)\n- **Current gap**: Errors are logged but not fed back into agent context\n- **Pattern**: \"Good agents examine and correct errors when something goes wrong\"\n- **Improvement**: Add error accumulator that feeds into retry prompts\n\n### 4. Parallelize Carefully (p.31)\n- **Current gap**: We spawn parallel agents but don't ensure context sharing\n- **Pattern**: \"Ensure subagents can share context along the way\"\n- **Improvement**: Add `swarm_broadcast` for mid-task context updates\n\n### 5. List Failure Modes (p.46)\n- **Current gap**: No classification of why agent failures occur\n- **Pattern**: \"Create classification process for agent failures\"\n- **Improvement**: Add failure taxonomy to swarm_record_outcome\n\n### 6. Tool Calling Best Practices (Principles p.36)\n- **Current gap**: Tool descriptions are functional but not semantic\n- **Pattern**: \"Use semantic naming that matches tool's purpose\"\n- **Improvement**: Audit all tool descriptions for semantic clarity\n\n### 7. Workflows as Tools (Principles p.109)\n- **Current gap**: Swarm is a command, not composable\n- **Pattern**: \"Multi-agent architecture = primitives + arrangement\"\n- **Improvement**: Make swarm_decompose callable from other workflows\n\n### 8. Implicit Feedback Scoring (already implemented)\n- **Current strength**: swarm_record_outcome tracks duration/errors/retries\n- **Enhancement**: Add strategy-specific scoring (file-based vs feature-based)\n\n## Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)\n\n1. **HIGH**: Context compression between subtasks\n2. **HIGH**: Error accumulator for retry prompts  \n3. **MEDIUM**: Failure mode taxonomy\n4. **MEDIUM**: Mid-task context broadcast\n5. **LOW**: Semantic tool description audit\n6. **LOW**: Composable workflow primitives","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-10T10:02:37.4266-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-10T11:06:06.392-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-10T11:06:06.392-08:00"}
