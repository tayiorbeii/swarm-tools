Can wrap existing PGLite instance.\n\n2. **Migration Strategy:** COEXISTENCE - Keep migrations.ts for existing tables, use Drizzle for new features. Gradual migration over time.\n\n3. **Type-Safety Benefits:** 70 SQL patterns identified. Drizzle provides compile-time checking, auto JSONB handling, type inference.\n\n4. **DatabaseAdapter Impact:** DrizzleDatabaseAdapter wrapper recommended (8h effort). Zero breaking changes for consumers.\n\n5. **Effort Estimate:** ~87 hours (2-3 weeks) for full migration. Recommend phased approach.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. Create Drizzle schema definitions for existing tables\n2. Implement DrizzleDatabaseAdapter wrapper\n3. Add integration tests (equivalence check)\n4. Migrate high-value operations incrementally\n\n### Reference\n\nCourse Builder has working adapter-drizzle package at badass-courses/course-builder that demonstrates the pattern.\n\nSee related bead: opencode-swarm-plugin-13fho","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:16:07.49403-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T12:23:31.775155-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-16T12:23:31.775155-08:00"}

Verification Gate in swarm_complete\nAdd the Gate Function (IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → CLAIM) to swarm_complete:\n- Run UBS scan (already exists)\n- Run typecheck\n- Verify tests pass\n- Only then mark complete\n- Block completion if verification fails\n\n**Files:** src/swarm.ts (swarm_complete function)\n\n### 2. CSO Validation in skills_create\nAdd Claude Search Optimization validation when creating skills:\n- Description starts with \"Use when...\"\n- Description \u003c 500 chars (warn if \u003e 1024)\n- Third-person only (no \"I\", \"you\")\n- Contains trigger keywords\n- Name follows conventions (gerunds, verb-first)\n\n**Files:** src/skills.ts (skills_create function)\n\n### 3. 3-Strike Detection in debug-plus\nTrack fix attempts per issue. After 3 failures:\n- STOP and surface architecture question\n- Don't attempt Fix #4\n- Require human decision before continuing\n\n**Files:** examples/commands/debug-plus.md (or create if doesn't exist)\n\n### 4. Socratic Strategy for Swarm\nAdd \"socratic\" strategy to swarm decomposition:\n- Detect ambiguous tasks (no files, vague verbs, large scope)\n- One question at a time refinement\n- Multiple choice preferred\n- 200-300 word validation sections\n- Auto-transition to decomposition when validated\n\n**Files:** src/swarm.ts (swarm_select_strategy, swarm_plan_prompt)\n\n### 5. Coordinator Context Preservation Pattern\nUpdate swarm coordinator workflow to:\n- Create planning bead with full context FIRST\n- Delegate planning to subagent (not main thread)\n- Subagent returns structured BeadTree JSON\n- Coordinator validates and creates beads\n\n**Files:** examples/commands/swarm.md, global-skills/swarm-coordination/SKILL.md\n\n## Reference Documents\n- docs/analysis-socratic-planner-pattern.md\n- VERIFICATION_QUALITY_PATTERNS.md\n- docs/analysis/subagent-coordination-patterns.md\n- .beads/analysis/skill-architecture-meta-skills.md\n\n## Pattern Beads (for reference)\n- opencode-swarm-plugin-xwlda (Socratic Planner)\n- opencode-swarm-plugin-cyc8w (Verification Before Completion)\n- opencode-swarm-plugin-9lksy (3-Strike Architecture Rule)\n- opencode-swarm-plugin-2klp9 (CSO)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- swarm_complete blocks on failed verification\n- skills_create warns on poor CSO\n- debug-plus stops after 3 failed fixes\n- /swarm detects ambiguous tasks and refines them\n- Coordinator delegates planning to subagent","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T14:07:39.259162-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T15:51:02.161099-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T15:51:02.161099-08:00"}

{"id":"opencode-swarm-plugin-7lb2r","title":"Set up OIDC CI/CD via GitHub Actions for npm publishing","description":"## Goal\nConfigure trusted publishing for both npm packages using GitHub Actions OIDC - no long-lived npm tokens needed.\n\n## Packages\n- `swarm-mail` (packages/swarm-mail)\n- `opencode-swarm-plugin` (packages/opencode-swarm-plugin)\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Configure Trusted Publishers on npmjs.com\nFor each package, go to Settings → Trusted Publisher:\n- Organization: `joelhooks`\n- Repository: `opencode-swarm-plugin`\n- Workflow filename: `publish.yml`\n- Environment: `npm` (optional, for deployment protection)\n\n### 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow\nCreate `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish Packages\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n\npermissions:\n  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC\n  contents: read\n\njobs:\n  publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '22'\n          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'\n\n      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n        with:\n          bun-version: latest\n\n      - name: Update npm (need 11.5.1+ for OIDC)\n        run: npm install -g npm@latest\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: bun install\n\n      - name: Build packages\n        run: bun turbo build\n\n      - name: Run tests\n        run: bun turbo test\n\n      - name: Publish swarm-mail\n        working-directory: packages/swarm-mail\n        run: npm publish --access public\n\n      - name: Publish opencode-swarm-plugin\n        working-directory: packages/opencode-swarm-plugin\n        run: npm publish --access public\n```\n\n### 3. Security Best Practices\n- [ ] Enable \"Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens\" on npmjs.com after verifying OIDC works\n- [ ] Revoke any existing automation tokens\n- [ ] Provenance attestations will be auto-generated (cryptographic proof of build origin)\n\n### 4. Release Process\n```bash\n# Bump versions in both package.json files\n# Then tag and push:\ngit tag v0.23.0\ngit push origin v0.23.0\n```\n\n## Requirements\n- npm CLI 11.5.1+ (for OIDC support)\n- GitHub-hosted runners (self-hosted not supported yet)\n- Public repository (for provenance generation)\n\n## References\n- [npm Trusted Publishing Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements#publishing-packages-with-provenance-via-github-actions)\n- [GitHub OIDC Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T19:50:13.250083-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T20:00:00.789685-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T20:00:00.789685-08:00"}

{"id":"opencode-swarm-plugin-anlp2","title":"AI Agent Pattern Research: Plugin Improvement Analysis","description":"Research synthesis from PDF library (Patterns for Building AI Agents, Principles of Building AI Agents, Training Complex Cognitive Skills) applied to opencode-swarm-plugin improvements.\n\n## Key Patterns Identified\n\n### 1. Context Engineering (from Patterns for Building AI Agents)\n- **Current gap**: Our SUBTASK_PROMPT is verbose but lacks structured context sections\n- **Pattern**: \"Context engineering is both art and science\" - Karpathy\n- **Improvement**: Add explicit context sections: [IDENTITY] [TASK] [CONSTRAINTS] [TOOLS] [OUTPUT]\n\n### 2. Context Compression (p.37-39)\n- **Current gap**: No automatic context pruning between agent tasks\n- **Pattern**: \"Periodic context compression can prune irrelevant context\"\n- **Improvement**: Add `swarm_compress_context` tool that summarizes completed work\n\n### 3. Feed Errors Into Context (p.40)\n- **Current gap**: Errors are logged but not fed back into agent context\n- **Pattern**: \"Good agents examine and correct errors when something goes wrong\"\n- **Improvement**: Add error accumulator that feeds into retry prompts\n\n### 4. Parallelize Carefully (p.31)\n- **Current gap**: We spawn parallel agents but don't ensure context sharing\n- **Pattern**: \"Ensure subagents can share context along the way\"\n- **Improvement**: Add `swarm_broadcast` for mid-task context updates\n\n### 5. List Failure Modes (p.46)\n- **Current gap**: No classification of why agent failures occur\n- **Pattern**: \"Create classification process for agent failures\"\n- **Improvement**: Add failure taxonomy to swarm_record_outcome\n\n### 6. Tool Calling Best Practices (Principles p.36)\n- **Current gap**: Tool descriptions are functional but not semantic\n- **Pattern**: \"Use semantic naming that matches tool's purpose\"\n- **Improvement**: Audit all tool descriptions for semantic clarity\n\n### 7. Workflows as Tools (Principles p.109)\n- **Current gap**: Swarm is a command, not composable\n- **Pattern**: \"Multi-agent architecture = primitives + arrangement\"\n- **Improvement**: Make swarm_decompose callable from other workflows\n\n### 8. Implicit Feedback Scoring (already implemented)\n- **Current strength**: swarm_record_outcome tracks duration/errors/retries\n- **Enhancement**: Add strategy-specific scoring (file-based vs feature-based)\n\n## Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)\n\n1. **HIGH**: Context compression between subtasks\n2. **HIGH**: Error accumulator for retry prompts  \n3. **MEDIUM**: Failure mode taxonomy\n4. **MEDIUM**: Mid-task context broadcast\n5. **LOW**: Semantic tool description audit\n6. **LOW**: Composable workflow primitives","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-10T10:02:37.4266-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-10T11:06:06.392-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-10T11:06:06.392-08:00"}

Swarm Learning\n- After swarm_complete: auto-store learnings about what worked/failed\n- After 3-strike: store architectural insights\n- Pattern maturity transitions: store why patterns got promoted/deprecated\n\n### 2. Decomposition\n- Before decomposing: query semantic-memory for similar past tasks\n- Store successful decomposition strategies with task characteristics\n- Learn which strategies work for which task types\n\n### 3. Skills\n- When skill is used successfully: reinforce in memory\n- When skill fails to help: store negative signal\n- Auto-suggest skills based on memory of past similar situations\n\n### 4. Error Handling\n- Store error patterns and their solutions\n- Query memory when hitting errors (before CASS)\n- Build project-specific error knowledge base\n\n### 5. Beads\n- Store context when closing beads (what was learned)\n- Query memory when starting similar beads\n- Track which approaches worked for which problem types\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### Auto-store on key events\n```typescript\n// In swarm_complete\nif (success) {\n  semantic_memory_store({\n    information: `Task \"${title}\" succeeded with strategy \"${strategy}\".

Multiple layers = \"We made the bug structurally impossible.\"\n\n### The 4 Layers\n**Layer 1: Entry Point Validation**\n- Reject obviously invalid input at API boundary\n- Check: not empty, exists, is correct type\n\n**Layer 2: Business Logic Validation**\n- Ensure data makes sense for this operation\n- Check: required fields, valid ranges, business rules\n\n**Layer 3: Environment Guards**\n- Prevent dangerous operations in specific contexts\n- Example: Refuse git init outside temp dir during tests\n\n**Layer 4: Debug Instrumentation**\n- Capture context for forensics\n- Log: directory, cwd, environment, stack trace\n\n### Why All 4 Layers\nAll four layers are necessary because:\n- Different code paths bypass entry validation\n- Mocks bypass business logic checks\n- Edge cases on different platforms need environment guards\n- Debug logging identifies structural misuse\n\n### Application Process\nWhen you find a bug:\n1. **Trace the data flow** - Where does bad value originate?

{"id":"opencode-swarm-plugin-simya","title":"Pattern: Fresh Subagent Per Task - No Context Pollution","description":"## Fresh Subagent Per Task (from obra/superpowers)\n\n**Core Principle:** Each agent starts clean, reads requirements, executes, reports back. No context pollution.\n\n### Why Fresh Subagents\n- TDD comes naturally (no accumulated assumptions)\n- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)\n- Catches issues early (code review after each task)\n- Cheaper than debugging cascading failures\n\n### Subagent-Driven Development Workflow\n1. Load plan, create TodoWrite\n2. For each task:\n   - Dispatch implementation subagent\n   - Dispatch code-reviewer subagent\n   - Fix issues from review (dispatch fix subagent, NOT manual)\n   - Mark complete\n3. Final review of entire implementation\n4. Use finishing-a-development-branch skill\n\n### Agent Prompt Best Practices\n**1. Focused** - One clear problem domain\n```\n❌ \"Fix all the tests\"\n✓ \"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\"\n```\n\n**2. Self-contained** - All context needed\n```\n❌ \"Fix the race condition\"\n✓ \"Fix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:\n   1. 'should abort tool with partial output capture'...\"\n```\n\n**3. Specific about output**\n```\n❌ \"Fix it\"\n✓ \"Return: Summary of root cause and what you fixed\"\n```\n\n**4. Constraints** - Prevent scope creep\n```\n✓ \"Do NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue\"\n✓ \"Don't refactor - minimal changes to make tests pass\"\n```\n\n### Red Flags\n- Skip code review between tasks\n- Proceed with unfixed Critical issues\n- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)\n- Fix subagent failures manually (context pollution)\n\n**Full analysis:** docs/analysis/subagent-coordination-patterns.md","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-13T14:00:40.843556-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T15:50:54.544856-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T15:50:54.544856-08:00"}

Start a swarm subtask\n2. Call `swarm_complete()` with files_touched array\n3. Returns \"Error: Tool execution failed\" with no details\n\n## Expected Behavior\nShould return the actual error message with:\n- Which step failed (verification, UBS, bd close, etc.)\n- The specific error from that step\n- Recovery suggestions\n\n## Files\n- src/swarm-orchestrate.ts:1013-1505 (swarm_complete tool)\n- Possibly plugin.ts or index.ts error handling wrapper","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-14T15:18:39.249083-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T07:15:29.023511-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-15T07:15:29.023511-08:00"}
